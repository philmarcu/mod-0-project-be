# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
# YOUR CODE HERE
p house_elf
# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
# YOUR CODE HERE
name = 'Harry must not return to Hogwarts!'
p name
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts "#{students + 2}"

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts "#{students - 2}"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Phil"
is_hungry = "yes"
number_of_pets = "none"

puts "I am #{first_name}, #{is_hungry} I could eat and I have #{number_of_pets}, no pets. "

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.

p "I wanted to make a complete sentence out of simple phrases and keep it identifiable."

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "John"
is_hungry = "went to Denny's"
number_of_pets = "Old Yeller Marty"

puts "So that guy #{first_name} had #{is_hungry} and picked up food for #{number_of_pets}"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = 14;
puts "#{healthy_snacks} + #{junk_food_snacks} = #{total_snacks}"

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
