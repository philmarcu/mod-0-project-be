## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

-Mainly that the SMART Goals is a great way to break down tasks in a way that makes it manageable.
I can get so lost in the small details that ends up being a bigger time sink than expected, having something like that is helpful to keep a steadier approach to learning.

-It's not about going way outside of your repertoire - doing code challenges that push you into learning is valuable.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

-I believe I best demonstrate a growth mindset with my note-taking + review process. I regularly
go back over old notes to memorize the process of how terminal/git/ruby process code.

-The way that I don't demonstrate a growth mindset is probably thru the problem-solving; I still am figuring out how certain
functions will end up being utilized in my future projects. The examples make sense but I need more examples and exercises
where I mix more methods, functions, and variables together to see how they interact.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is  a fork in the road - your data reaches a conditional and the conditional tells the data where to go.
The data winds up in one of the if-statements that branch off of the conditional.
Examples

Ex. 1 - "If there's snow outside then we cannot go to school today"
Ex. 2 - "If I eat too much then I will get sick"
Ex. 3 - "If I don't get a haircut then my hair will be too messy"

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

When I want to branch different paths for the data to go depending on the users' information they've inputted in.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if variable = x
  p "This is the outcome"
end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

By using the && operator to add another condition

ex. - if name == "Marcus" && country == "Barbados"
        p "Marcus' origins from the Caribbean"
end

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:


Ex.1 - donuts = 12

if donuts = 13 and
  p "We got the right order from Lamars."
elsif donuts < 13 and
  p "We got the wrong order!"
elsif donuts > 13 and
  p "We've got the wrong order!"
end

Ex. 2- stock = 10

if stock < 1
  puts "Sorry we are out of stock!"
end
